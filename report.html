<h2><strong>Motivation</strong></h2>
<p>The motivation for this research is to evaluate food safety practices
in Manhattan through the New York City Department of Health and Mental
Hygiene (DOHMH) Restaurant Inspection Results dataset. This dataset
includes critical variables such as inspection scores, grades, and
violation descriptions, providing a foundation for analyzing trends and
identifying common issues in restaurant hygiene. Our focus is to uncover
patterns in food safety practices, highlight areas needing improvement,
and identify restaurants that consistently meet high standards. By doing
so, we aim to provide valuable insights for diners seeking safe and
high-quality dining experiences and contribute to the ongoing efforts to
maintain and improve public health standards in Manhattan’s diverse
dining landscape.</p>
</div>
<div id="related-work" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>Related Work</strong></h2>
<p>We were inspired to undertake this analysis after examining the <a
href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-New-York-City-Restaurant-Inspection-Results/43nn-pn8j/about_data">DOHMH
Restaurant Inspection Results dataset</a> available on <a
href="https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/">NYC OpenData</a>. This dataset
offers comprehensive details on restaurant inspections, including
grades, scores, violation descriptions, and locations, making it an
excellent resource for studying food safety practices and trends in
Manhattan. Its depth and variety present a valuable opportunity to apply
data visualization and interactivity techniques while addressing
practical public health issues covered in our coursework.</p>
</div>
<div id="initial-questions" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>Initial Questions</strong></h2>
<p>Our initial questions focused on restaurant hygiene issues in
Manhattan, aiming to help people identify restaurants that are both
suitable for their taste preferences and meet high hygiene standards. We
were interested in the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>What is the most common cuisine type among restaurants in
Manhattan, and what are their hygiene ratings?</p></li>
<li><p>Are there significant differences in inspection scores among
different critical violations and location respectively?</p></li>
<li><p>Which cuisine types are more prone to critical health
violations?</p></li>
<li><p>How are inspection grades (A, B, C) distributed across different
part of Manhattan?</p></li>
<li><p>How does the cuisine type, inspection type, violation type,
location impact our overall hygiene grading?</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="data" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>Data</strong></h2>
<p>This dataset is derived from the <a
href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-New-York-City-Restaurant-Inspection-Results/43nn-pn8j/about_data">DOHMH
New York City Restaurant Inspection Results Dataset</a> and has been
specifically processed to focus on restaurant inspection results from
Manhattan for this project. It includes detailed records of health code
violations, inspection grades, and scores from establishments in active
status.</p>
<p>To prepare the data for analysis, we performed the following cleaning
steps:</p>
<p>Filtered the dataset to include only records where the
(<code>BORO</code>) field corresponds to <em>Manhattan</em>.</p>
<p>Removed entries with missing critical fields, such as
(<code>DBA</code>) (restaurant name), (<code>CUISINE</code>)
(<code>DESCRIPTION</code>), (<code>SCORE</code>), or
(<code>GRADE</code>).</p>
<p>Verified consistency in inspection dates and formatted them in date
format. Standardized continuous variables like (<code>SCORE</code>) to
ensure numeric values were properly stored.</p>
<p>Ensured all categorical variables, such as (<code>GRADE</code>), were
appropriately formatted and complete.</p>
<p>The final data used for analysis, saved <a
href="https://github.com/katherinewang0903/final_nyc_restaurant.github.io/blob/main/Manhattan_Restaurant_Inspection_Results.csv">here</a>,
contains 94,616 observations and includes the following variables:</p>

<h2><strong>Exploratory Analysis</strong></h2>
<div id="demographics-analysis" class="section level3">
<h3><a
href="https://katherinewang0903.github.io/final_nyc_restaurant.github.io/demographics.html">Demographics
Analysis</a></h3>
<p>For Demographics analysis, we focuses on the Manhattan’s restaurants
across three dimensions: physical location, popular types of cuisine,
and health inspection grades. The dataset was cleaned to include
complete records, categorizing restaurants into three regions—Downtown,
Midtown, and Uptown—based on ZIP codes. Restaurants graded as Z (Grade
Pending), P (Pending Reopening), and N (Not Yet Graded) were excluded to
ensure clarity and relevance in evaluating distribution patterns.</p>
<p>The Physical Location analysis provides an overview of restaurant
locations across Manhattan, allowing us to see each restaurant’s name,
cuisine type, geographic location, and health inspection grade. This
distribution reflects how restaurants cluster in different areas.
Midtown and Downtown Manhattan have a high concentration of restaurants,
while Uptown Manhattan has significantly fewer establishments. This
pattern can be attributed to several factors: Midtown and Downtown are
bustling commercial hubs with higher population density, more office
spaces, and greater tourism activity, all of which drive demand for
dining options. In contrast, Uptown has a lower density of commercial
spaces and fewer tourist attractions, resulting in less restaurant
clustering.</p>
<p>Cuisine Type analysis reveals that American cuisine dominates with
2,456 establishments, followed by Chinese, Italian, and Japanese
cuisines, which represent Manhattan’s multicultural dining scene.
Additionally, Coffee/Tea establishments rank prominently with over 1,000
locations, catering to the city’s fast-paced lifestyle. This breakdown
highlights a wide diversity in dining options, with quick-service and
globally inspired cuisines holding substantial market.</p>
<p>The Health Inspection Grade Distribution shows that most Manhattan
restaurants maintain high hygiene standards, with Grade A being the most
common, ranging from 50% to 80%. Coffee/Tea (80%) and French (70%)
cuisines lead in hygiene compliance, while Bakery Products/Desserts
(50%) have the lowest proportion of Grade A, highlighting room for
improvement. Chinese and Japanese cuisines show greater variability,
with higher proportions of lower grades (B and C) and pending grades (Z
and P), suggesting specific challenges in meeting food safety standards.
These results underscore the need for targeted interventions to support
improved hygiene practices across all cuisine types.</p>

<div id="violations-analysis" class="section level3">
<h3><a
href="https://katherinewang0903.github.io/final_nyc_restaurant.github.io/violations.html">Violations
Analysis</a></h3>
<p>As for analysis related to violation, we focuses exclusively on data
where the grades are A, B, or C, and excludes records with grades
labeled as N (Not Yet Graded), Z (Grade Pending), or P (Grade Pending
issued upon reopening after a closure). We also exclude “Not Applicable”
entries for critical violation indicators. Inspection violations are
categorized into two groups: Critical and Not Critical. Critical
violations represent the most significant risks for foodborne illnesses.
To ensure accuracy and relevance, we begin by filtering out unnecessary
data from the dataset before proceeding with the analysis.</p>
<p>First, we analyze the frequency distribution of grades. For both
Critical and Not Critical groups, the majority of restaurants received a
Grade A, followed by Grade B, and then Grade C. However, only within
Grade A do we observe more restaurants with Not Critical violations
compared to Critical violations. Additionally, when examining inspection
scores across all grade categories, restaurants with Not Critical
violations consistently achieve lower scores. This pattern aligns with
the corresponding grade results, further highlighting the relationship
between inspection outcomes and grade assignments.</p>
<p>Next, we conducted a Chi-Square Test to examine the relationship
between the critical flag and grade. The results are visualized using a
Contingency Table Heatmap. The analysis shows a p-value smaller than
0.05, leading us to reject the null hypothesis that the critical flag
and grade are independent. This indicates a significant relationship
between the critical flag and grade at the 0.05 significance level.</p>
<p>Among all restaurants with critical violations, we aimed to identify
the most common types of violations. To achieve this, we calculated the
percentage of each violation type and grouped all categories with less
than 3% into an “Other” category for clarity. The results are summarized
in a pie chart, providing a clear visualization of the distribution of
critical violations. The analysis reveals that the most frequent
critical violation is related to washing and temperature problem. These
are more than a quarter in total percentage. This finding underscores
the importance of proper temperature management and remain cleaning in
ensuring food safety and reducing the risk of foodborne illnesses. Also,
restaurants owner who want to avoid bad grade in inspection need to
perticullar pay attention to them.</p>

<div id="location-vs.-grade-analysis" class="section level3">
<h3><a
href="https://katherinewang0903.github.io/final_nyc_restaurant.github.io/location.html">Location
vs. Grade Analysis</a></h3>
<p>In this chapter, we analyze the relationship between locations and
grades. Our analysis focuses exclusively on data where the grades are
<code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, or <code>C</code>, and excludes records
with grades labeled as N (Not Yet Graded), Z (Grade Pending), or P
(Grade Pending issued upon reopening after a closure). To ensure
accuracy and relevance, we begin by filtering out unnecessary data from
the dataset before proceeding with the analysis. The location is divided
by <code>Financial District</code>, <code>Chinatown</code>,
<code>West Village</code>, <code>Upper East Side</code>,
<code>Upper West Side</code>, <code>Harlem</code>,
<code>Washington Heights</code>, <code>East Village</code>,
<code>Chelsea</code>, <code>Battery Park City</code>,
<code>Bowery</code>, <code>SoHo</code>, <code>Gramercy Park</code>,
<code>Flatiron District</code>, <code>Carnegie Hill</code>,
<code>Tribeca</code>, <code>Governors Island</code>,
<code>Midtown</code>, <code>Roosevelt Island</code>,
<code>Other</code>.</p>
<p>To investigate if where restaurants are located influence their
inspection grades, we produce <code>Chi-Square test</code>. The result
is presented in the <code>Contingency Table Heatmap</code> below. The
<code>Chi-Square statistics</code> is 584.26, and
<code>p-value is less than 0.05</code>, leading us to reject the null
hypothesis that <code>the region and grade are independent</code>. This
indicates a there a significant difference in the distribution of grades
among regions at the 0.05 significance level. <br> The
<code>Midtown</code> region exhibits the highest concentration of Grade
A restaurants, as indicated by the darkest shade of purple. Other
regions like <code>Upper East Side</code> and
<code>Upper West Side</code> also show substantial numbers of Grade A
restaurants. <code>Grades B and C</code> are less frequent across all
regions, with the light shading indicating their relatively low
counts.</p>
<p>To investigate how strong the association is between locations and
grades, we produce <code>Cramér’s V test</code>. The
<code>Cramér’s V Value is  0.085</code>, which is less than 0.1, so that
we conclude locations and grades have <code>weak association</code>.
This conclusion is visualized in the stacked bar charts below of
different regions that we can’t tell large difference among them.</p>
<p>This stacked bar chart illustrates the distribution of hygiene grades
across various regions in Manhattan. Grade A, represented in blue,
dominates most regions. In contrast, regions such as <code>Harlem</code>
and <code>Washington Heights</code> show a slightly higher proportion of
lower grades (B and C), indicating potential areas for improvement. Some
regions, like <code>Roosevelt Island</code>, almost exclusively maintain
grade A ratings, showcasing exceptional cleanliness. However, since only
slightly differences among locations are shown, the result fits that the
association is weak.</p>

<div id="cuisine-types-analysis" class="section level3">
<h3><a
href="https://katherinewang0903.github.io/final_nyc_restaurant.github.io/cuisine.html">Cuisine
Types Analysis</a></h3>
<p>The aim of this analysis is to evaluate restaurant hygiene trends
across Manhattan, focusing on inspection scores and their variability by
cuisine type and location. Using interactive visualizations, we identify
patterns in hygiene performance and highlight areas and cuisines
requiring improvement.</p>
<p>NYC restaurant inspections categorize hygiene performance into:
<code>Grade A</code>: Scores below 14, indicating excellent hygiene.
<code>Grade B</code>: Scores between 14 and 27, showing acceptable
hygiene. <code>Grade C</code>: Scores of 28 or higher, suggesting poor
hygiene.</p>
<p>Density Map of Inspection Scores <br> The interactive density map,
created with plot_ly, visualizes average restaurant inspection scores
across Manhattan. Data was filtered to include valid latitude,
longitude, and inspection scores. A Viridis color scale highlights score
variations from 0 (best) to 40 (worst). Users can click on points to
view specific scores by location, enhancing interactivity and offering a
geographic perspective on hygiene trends.</p>
<p>Top 35 Cuisine Types by Average Inspection Scores <br> This bar chart
ranks the top 35 cuisine types by their average inspection scores. Using
data grouped by <code>CUISINE DESCRIPTION</code>, we calculated mean
scores and visually represented them with orange bars and purple
borders. Cuisines like Bangladeshi, African, and Filipino have the
highest average scores, indicating hygiene challenges, while cuisines
such as Japanese and Mediterranean rank lower, reflecting better
hygiene. This highlights cuisines that may benefit from targeted
interventions.</p>
<p>Inspection Score Distribution for Top 35 Cuisine Types <br> The
boxplot illustrates the variability in inspection scores among the top
35 cuisines. Data was filtered to include only these cuisines, and
boxplots were generated to display ranges, interquartile ranges (IQR),
and outliers. Cuisines like Bangladeshi and African show wide score
ranges and higher medians, suggesting inconsistent hygiene performance.
In contrast, Japanese and Mediterranean cuisines exhibit narrow
distributions with lower medians, indicating more consistent hygiene
standards. This complements the bar chart by providing deeper insight
into score variability.</p>

Analysis</a></h3>
<p>We analyzed how restaurant grades have evolved over time, focusing on
neighborhoods and cuisine types, with Italian restaurants as a case
study to evaluate trends within a specific cuisine.</p>
<p>The first line chart shows hygiene grade trends across Manhattan
restaurants. Grade <code>A</code> dominates, with a sharp rise around
2022, likely due to improved hygiene practices or policy changes. Grades
<code>B</code> and <code>C</code> increased slightly post-2020 but
remain much lower, while other grades (<code>N</code>, <code>P</code>,
<code>Z</code>) are minimally represented, emphasizing the focus on
achieving grade <code>A</code>.</p>
<p>The second line chart shows grade trends for Italian restaurants,
highlighting a similar sharp rise in grade <code>A</code> around 2022.
Grades <code>B</code> and <code>C</code> showed slight increases but
remained infrequent, while other grades were rarely observed. This trend
reflects a strong emphasis on maintaining high cleanliness standards
among Italian restaurants.</p>
<p>Univariable Ordinal Regression <br> We conducted a univariable
ordinal regression to examine the relationship between restaurant grades
(<code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, <code>C</code>) and predictors like
<code>cuisine type</code>, <code>inspection type</code>,
<code>violation code</code>, and <code>location</code>. Grades were
converted to numeric values (<code>1</code> for <code>A</code>,
<code>2</code> for <code>B</code>, <code>3</code> for <code>C</code>)
for ordinal modeling. Positive estimates indicated a tendency toward
poorer grades, while negative estimates reflected better grades.
<code>P-values</code> assessed the significance of these associations.
To enhance interpretation, we showcased the top 10 results, highlighting
the strongest associations. For instance, <code>African</code> and
<code>Asian/Asian Fusion</code> cuisines had statistically significant
positive associations with poorer grades, offering insights for further
exploration.</p>
<p>Residual Diagnostics <br> We performed residual diagnostics on a
generalized linear model (<code>GLM</code>) with a
<code>quasipoisson</code> family to handle overdispersion. The
<code>Q-Q plot</code> of residuals showed most data points aligning with
the purple reference line, indicating normality. However, deviations at
the tails suggest potential outliers or non-normality in extreme values.
While the model fits well overall, further adjustments may address these
discrepancies to improve fit.</p>

<h2><strong>Shiny app</strong></h2>
<p>The Shiny app <a
href="https://katherinewang0903.shinyapps.io/shinyapp/">HERE</a>
provides an interactive platform for exploring Manhattan’s restaurant
inspection data by allowing users to filter by region, cuisine type, and
hygiene grade. The provided neighborhoods include the Financial
District, Chinatown, West Village, Upper East Side, Upper West Side,
Harlem, Washington Heights, East Village, Chelsea, Battery Park City,
Bowery, SoHo, Gramercy Park, Flatiron District, Carnegie Hill, Tribeca,
Governors Island, Midtown, and Roosevelt Island. Once filters are
applied, all matching restaurants are displayed as clickable points on
an interactive map.</p>
<p>When users click on a specific point, a popup box appears, providing
detailed information about the restaurant, including its name, cuisine
type, inspection grade, hygiene score, and neighborhood region. This
interactive feature makes it convenient for users to visually analyze
restaurant distribution, hygiene trends, and specific options available
in their selected area. The map interface, combined with the filtering
functionality, offers an engaging and user-friendly way to understand
the restaurant hygiene landscape in Manhattan.</p>

<div id="discussion" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>Discussion</strong></h2>
<p>Our analysis of the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene’s
Restaurant Inspection Results dataset revealed several critical findings
about restaurant hygiene and compliance within Manhattan. One notable
discovery was the variation in inspection scores across different
neighborhoods, highlighting areas with more frequent critical
violations. This suggests the need for targeted interventions in
specific locations to ensure food safety standards are upheld.
Additionally, our exploration into cuisine types indicated that certain
food preparation styles are associated with higher or lower hygiene
scores, shedding light on potential risks tied to specific cuisines.</p>
<p>Another significant trend was the impact of critical violations on
restaurant grades. Restaurants with repeated critical violations often
received lower grades, emphasizing the importance of promptly addressing
such issues to maintain customer trust and public health standards.
Interestingly, we also observed fluctuations in overall hygiene
compliance over time, potentially reflecting changes in enforcement
practices or restaurant management priorities.</p>
<p>Recent news articles have supported these findings, with reports
indicating a decline in the frequency of health inspections due to
staffing shortages. According to <a
href="https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/nyc-restaurant-health-inspections-2023-2024/">CBS
News</a> about NYC Manhattan restaurant health inspections. Health
inspections in Mahanttan have decreased by 17% in the past year, raising
concerns about consistent enforcement of safety standards. This aligns
with our observations of varying compliance levels, reinforcing the
critical need for consistent oversight. By addressing these issues and
promoting better compliance across all establishments, Manhattan’s
dining scene can remain both vibrant and safe for all patrons.</p>
