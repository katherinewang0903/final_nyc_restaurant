### Motivation

The motivation for this research is to evaluate food safety practices in Manhattan through the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) Restaurant Inspection Results dataset. This dataset includes critical variables such as inspection scores, grades, and violation descriptions, providing a foundation for analyzing trends and identifying common issues in restaurant hygiene. Our focus is to uncover patterns in food safety practices, highlight areas needing improvement, and identify restaurants that consistently meet high standards. By doing so, we aim to provide valuable insights for diners seeking safe and high-quality dining experiences and contribute to the ongoing efforts to maintain and improve public health standards in Manhattan's diverse dining landscape.

### Related work

We were inspired to undertake this analysis after examining the [DOHMH Restaurant Inspection Results dataset](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-New-York-City-Restaurant-Inspection-Results/43nn-pn8j/about_data) available on [NYC OpenData](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/). This dataset offers comprehensive details on restaurant inspections, including grades, scores, violation descriptions, and locations, making it an excellent resource for studying food safety practices and trends in Manhattan. Its depth and variety present a valuable opportunity to apply data visualization and interactivity techniques while addressing practical public health issues covered in our coursework.

After exploratory analysis and better understanding the strengths (large sample) and limitations (few obvious spacial trends, short observation period) of our data, we adjusted our questions to be:

### Data

This dataset is derived from the [DOHMH New York City Restaurant Inspection Results Dataset](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-New-York-City-Restaurant-Inspection-Results/43nn-pn8j/about_data) and has been specifically processed to focus on restaurant inspection results from Manhattan for this project. It includes detailed records of health code violations, inspection grades, and scores from establishments in active status. 

To prepare the data for analysis, we performed the following cleaning steps:

Filtered the dataset to include only records where the (`BORO`) field corresponds to *Manhattan*.

Removed entries with missing critical fields, such as (`DBA`) (restaurant name), (`CUISINE`) (`DESCRIPTION`), (`SCORE`), or (`GRADE`).

Verified consistency in inspection dates and formatted them in date format.
Standardized continuous variables like (`SCORE`) to ensure numeric values were properly stored.

Ensured all categorical variables, such as (`GRADE`), were appropriately formatted and complete.


The final data used for analysis, saved [here](https://github.com/katherinewang0903/final_nyc_restaurant.github.io/blob/main/Manhattan_Restaurant_Inspection_Results.csv), contains 94,616 observations and includes the following variables:

* `CAMIS`: Unique identifier for each restaurant establishment.
* `DBA`: Doing Business As (DBA) name of the establishment.
