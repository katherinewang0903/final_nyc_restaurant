### Motivation

The motivation for this research is to evaluate food safety practices in Manhattan through the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) Restaurant Inspection Results dataset. This dataset includes critical variables such as inspection scores, grades, and violation descriptions, providing a foundation for analyzing trends and identifying common issues in restaurant hygiene. Our focus is to uncover patterns in food safety practices, highlight areas needing improvement, and identify restaurants that consistently meet high standards. By doing so, we aim to provide valuable insights for diners seeking safe and high-quality dining experiences and contribute to the ongoing efforts to maintain and improve public health standards in Manhattan's diverse dining landscape.

<br>

### Related work

We were inspired to undertake this analysis after examining the [DOHMH Restaurant Inspection Results dataset](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-New-York-City-Restaurant-Inspection-Results/43nn-pn8j/about_data) available on [NYC OpenData](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/). This dataset offers comprehensive details on restaurant inspections, including grades, scores, violation descriptions, and locations, making it an excellent resource for studying food safety practices and trends in Manhattan. Its depth and variety present a valuable opportunity to apply data visualization and interactivity techniques while addressing practical public health issues covered in our coursework.

### Initial questions

Our initial questions focused on restaurant hygiene issues in Manhattan, aiming to help people identify restaurants that are both suitable for their taste preferences and meet high hygiene standards. We were interested in the following:

1. What is the most common cuisine type among restaurants in Manhattan, and what are their hygiene ratings?

2. Are there significant differences in inspection scores among different critical violations and location respectively?

3. Which cuisine types are more prone to critical health violations?

4. How are inspection grades (A, B, C) distributed across different part of Manhattan? 

5. How does the cuisine type, inspection type, violation type, location impact our overall hygiene grading?

<br>

### Data

This dataset is derived from the [DOHMH New York City Restaurant Inspection Results Dataset](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-New-York-City-Restaurant-Inspection-Results/43nn-pn8j/about_data) and has been specifically processed to focus on restaurant inspection results from Manhattan for this project. It includes detailed records of health code violations, inspection grades, and scores from establishments in active status. 

To prepare the data for analysis, we performed the following cleaning steps:

Filtered the dataset to include only records where the (`BORO`) field corresponds to *Manhattan*.

Removed entries with missing critical fields, such as (`DBA`) (restaurant name), (`CUISINE`) (`DESCRIPTION`), (`SCORE`), or (`GRADE`).

Verified consistency in inspection dates and formatted them in date format.
Standardized continuous variables like (`SCORE`) to ensure numeric values were properly stored.

Ensured all categorical variables, such as (`GRADE`), were appropriately formatted and complete.


The final data used for analysis, saved [here](https://github.com/katherinewang0903/final_nyc_restaurant.github.io/blob/main/Manhattan_Restaurant_Inspection_Results.csv), contains 94,616 observations and includes the following variables:

* `CAMIS`: Unique identifier for each restaurant establishment.
* `DBA`: Doing Business As (DBA) name of the establishment.
* `BORO`: Borough where the establishment is located (Cleaned data we used only includes Manhattan).
* `BUILDING`: Building number where the establishment is located.
* `STREET`: Street name where the establishment is located.
* `ZIPCODE`: ZIP Code of the establishment.
* `PHONE`: Phone number of the establishment.
* `CUISINE DESCRIPTION`: Type of cuisine served by the establishment.
* `INSPECTION DATE`: Date of the most recent inspection.
* `ACTION`: Action taken based on the inspection results.
* `VIOLATION CODE`: Code for the specific health code violation.
* `VIOLATION DESCRIPTION`: Description of the health code violation.
* `CRITICAL FLAG`: Indicator for critical health violations.
* `SCORE`: Score assigned based on inspection results.
* `GRADE`: Grade assigned to the establishment (A, B, C, etc.).
* `GRADE DATE`: Date when the grade was assigned.
* `RECORD DATE`: Date when the record was created or updated.
* `INSPECTION TYPE`: Type of inspection conducted (initial, reinspection, etc.).
* `Latitude`: Latitude coordinate of the establishment.
* `Longitude`: Longitude coordinate of the establishment.
* `Community Board`: Community Board where the establishment is located.
* `Council District`: Council District where the establishment is located.
* `Census Tract`: Census Tract where the establishment is located.
* `BIN`: Building Identification Number.
* `BBL`: Borough-Block-Lot number.
* `NTA`: Neighborhood Tabulation Area of the establishment.
* `Location Point1`: Geographic location of the establishment.

### Exploratory analysis
As for [analysis related to violation](https://katherinewang0903.github.io/final_nyc_restaurant.github.io/violations.html), we  focuses exclusively on data where the grades are A, B, or C, and excludes records with grades labeled as N (Not Yet Graded), Z (Grade Pending), or P (Grade Pending issued upon reopening after a closure). We also exclude “Not Applicable” entries for critical violation indicators. Inspection violations are categorized into two groups: Critical and Not Critical. Critical violations represent the most significant risks for foodborne illnesses. To ensure accuracy and relevance, we begin by filtering out unnecessary data from the dataset before proceeding with the analysis. <br>

First, we analyze the frequency distribution of grades. For both Critical and Not Critical groups, the majority of restaurants received a Grade A, followed by Grade B, and then Grade C. However, only within Grade A do we observe more restaurants with Not Critical violations compared to Critical violations. Additionally, when examining inspection scores across all grade categories, restaurants with Not Critical violations consistently achieve lower scores. This pattern aligns with the corresponding grade results, further highlighting the relationship between inspection outcomes and grade assignments. <br>

Next, we conducted a Chi-Square Test to examine the relationship between the critical flag and grade. The results are visualized using a Contingency Table Heatmap. The analysis shows a p-value smaller than 0.05, leading us to reject the null hypothesis that the critical flag and grade are independent. This indicates a significant relationship between the critical flag and grade at the 0.05 significance level. <br>

Among all restaurants with critical violations, we aimed to identify the most common types of violations. To achieve this, we calculated the percentage of each violation type and grouped all categories with less than 3% into an "Other" category for clarity. The results are summarized in a pie chart, providing a clear visualization of the distribution of critical violations. The analysis reveals that the most frequent critical violation is related to washing and temperature problem. These are more than a quarter in total percentage. This finding underscores the importance of proper temperature management and remain cleaning in ensuring food safety and reducing the risk of foodborne illnesses. Also, restaurants owner who want to avoid bad grade in inspection need to perticullar pay attention to them. <br>
