The motivation for this project is to explore public health within the context of dining in Manhattan by using the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) Restaurant Inspection Results dataset. Since food safety and eating clean are top priorities for the public, this dataset provides valuable insights with key columns such as BORO (borough), INSPECTION DATE, VIOLATION DESCRIPTION, SCORE, and GRADE. These details allow us to analyze specific food safety practices and trends within Manhattan's diverse dining environment. By examining this data, we aim to identify common violations, trends in inspection scores, and areas where safety standards may need improvement. Our focus on Manhattan aims to help diners identify their preferred types of cuisine while providing a list of the highest-rated and most hygienic restaurants, ensuring both safety and quality in their dining experiences.

The intended final deliverable include a comprehensive website that presents detailed insights into the hygiene conditions of restaurants in Manhattan, New York. The platform will feature a visual map displaying hygiene scores and historical records of critical violations for each establishment. Furthermore, an advanced recommendation page will be developed, allowing users to discover restaurants that match their preferences based on cuisine type, location, and hygiene rating. This initiative aims not only to provide valuable information to the public but also to promote establishments with high hygiene standards, thereby encouraging restaurant owners and staff to prioritize food safety and maintain exceptional sanitation practices.

The anticipated data sources: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-New-York-City-Restaurant-Inspection-Results/43nn-pn8j/about_data. The planned analyses: compare scores/grades of restaurants among different zip codes/cuisines in Manhattan. 

Visualizations:We will provide reader-friendly plots, such as a color-coded scatter plot to present different grades (A, B, C, Z, P, and N) of restaurants across different neighborhoods, a box plot to show the score distribution across various cuisine, and a bar chart to illustrate the number of high-scoring restaurants in different neighborhoods.

Coding challenges: combining a scatter plot of data with a map, coding a website to provide restaurants/addresses/phone numbers/scores based on usersâ€™ filters of address/cuisines/etc. 

The planned timeline: On Nov 5th, we will confirm our topic, analysis direction, plots, and dataset. From Nov 11th to 15th, we will meet with our TA and start data cleaning. Between Nov 18th and 22nd, we will create plots and begin building the website. From Nov 25th to 29th, we will finalize the website and collaborate on the report. The final submission is due on December 7th.
